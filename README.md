# open-brush-stroke-shaders
A large portion of the shaders in Open Brush now with stroke controls!
These modified shaders allow you to mimic the effect present when opening Open Brush. Strokes being replayed at a speed you can control using the `_ClipEnd` and `_ClipStart` properties on the shaders.

These shaders work as intended using `Unity 2021.3.4f1` with the `built-in render pipeline`.
